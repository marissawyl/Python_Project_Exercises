# Introduction

This first project marks the starting point of my Python and data analysis journey. Using the 2023 U.S. job postings dataset from _Luke Barousse_, I explored the data job market to understand how different roles, skills, and salaries connect across the field.

The main goal was to find patterns, such as which skills are most in demand, which tools define each role, and how these factors influence earning potential. Throughout this project, I practiced working with real-world data in Python, learning how to clean, analyze, and visualize it effectively to uncover clear insights.

# Background

The 2023 U.S. job market dataset was chosen because it offers one of the largest and most detailed views of data-related roles available online. The United States has a mature and dynamic analytics industry, making it an ideal place to explore real hiring trends and skill demand patterns. Working with this dataset helped me get used to the scale and complexity of real-world data, while practicing the essential steps of cleaning, organizing, and turning it into visual insights that tell a meaningful story about the data profession today.

# Questions to Analyze

These are the main questions explored in this project:

1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

# Tools Used

To gain insights into the data analyst job market, I worked with a range of tools and technologies that supported every stage of the project:

- **Python**: Served as the foundation of my analysis, helping me process data and uncover key insights. To extend its capabilities, I incorporated several powerful libraries:
    - **Pandas**: Used for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the dataset efficiently.
    - **Matplotlib**: Helped me build clear, data-driven visualizations.
    - **Seaborn**: Enhanced my charts with refined and professional visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provided an interactive space to experiment with code, document findings, and combine visuals with analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Offered a reliable and organized environment for writing and testing scripts.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

To start the project, I imported the necessary libraries and loaded the dataset into Python. After loading, I performed data cleanup to prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import ast
from datasets import load_dataset

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda skills: ast.literal_eval(skills) if pd.notna(skills) else skills)
```

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To figure this out, I first identified the top three roles based on popularity, then extracted the five most in-demand skills for each. The results highlight the leading job titles along with their key skills, helping me understand which areas to focus on depending on the role I want to pursue.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_pct[df_skills_pct['job_title_short'] == job_title].head()
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_pct', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r', legend=False)
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)

    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_pct']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.1f}%', va='center')
    
    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results

```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend=False, palette='hls')
sns.despine()
plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')

last_values = df_plot.iloc[-1, :]

offsets = {}

# Manually set the labels for 'tableau' and 'python' since they couldnâ€™t be adjusted with adjustText
for i, val in enumerate(last_values):
    floored = math.floor(val)
    if floored not in offsets:
        offsets[floored] = 0
    else:
        offsets[floored] += 2

    y = val - offsets[floored]
    plt.text(11.2, y, df_plot.columns[i], va='center')

plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()
```

### Results

![Skill_Trend](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Project_Exercises/blob/main/Exercise_1/images/Skills_Trend.png)

### Insights

- SQL consistently remained the most in-demand skill for Data Analysts throughout 2023, though it showed a slight downward trend over the year. This highlights how SQL continues to be the core technical requirement for analysts despite small fluctuations.
- Excel maintained a stable position as the second most requested skill, showing its continued relevance in day-to-day analysis and reporting tasks. However, it experienced a noticeable dip in the later months before recovering slightly in December.
- Python and Tableau followed a similar pattern with moderate demand, occasionally overlapping each other, while SAS consistently ranked the lowest. This suggests that while programming and visualization skills are valued, traditional tools like SAS are becoming less prioritized compared to modern alternatives.


## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To determine which roles and skills offer the highest salaries, I focused on job postings from the US and analyzed their median pay. Before diving into the details, I first examined the salary distributions for common data positions such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst to understand which roles typically command the highest compensation.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Project_Exercises/blob/main/Exercise_1/3_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_data_roles, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=median_salary.index)
sns.despine()
plt.xlim(0,600000)
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US', fontsize=15)

plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.show()
```

### Results

![Salary_Analysis](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Project_Exercises/blob/main/Exercise_1/images/Salary_Analysis_1.png)

### Insights

- Senior roles clearly command higher salaries across the board, with Senior Data Scientists and Senior Data Engineers showing the largest median salaries. This highlights how experience and advanced expertise significantly increase earning potential in the data field.
- Among non-senior positions, Data Scientists generally earn more than Data Engineers and Data Analysts, indicating that analytical and modeling skills tend to be valued higher than reporting or infrastructure-focused roles.
- An interesting observation is that Senior Data Analysts still earn less on average than non-senior Data Scientists and Data Engineers. This suggests that technical and modeling expertise in engineering and science roles tend to be rewarded more highly than seniority in purely analytical positions.

## Top-Paying and Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I refined the analysis to focus exclusively on data analyst positions. I examined both the skills that command the highest salaries and those that are most frequently requested. To illustrate these findings, I presented the results using two bar charts.

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

sns.barplot(
    data=high_salary,
    x='median',
    y=high_salary.index,
    ax=ax[0],
    hue='median',
    palette='dark:b_r',
    legend=False
)
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')

sns.barplot(
    data=top_skills_salary,
    x='median',
    y=top_skills_salary.index,
    ax=ax[1],
    hue='median',
    palette='light:b',
    legend=False
)
ax[1].set_xlim(0, 200000)
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')

for i in range(2):
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results

![Salary_Analysis](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Project_Exercises/blob/main/Exercise_1/images/Salary_Analysis.png)

### Insights

- The skills with the highest salaries for Data Analysts are mostly specialized or niche technologies such as dplyr, Bitbucket, GitLab, Solidity, and Hugging Face. This suggests that analysts who combine core analytical abilities with expertise in modern tools or programming frameworks can command significantly higher pay.
- In contrast, the most in-demand skills are more traditional and widely used, such as Python, Tableau, SQL, R, and Excel. These reflect the essential toolkit for most analyst roles, emphasizing versatility and practical application over specialization.
- The comparison highlights a clear gap between what is most valued in the job market and what is most common in everyday analyst work. While core skills drive employability, niche technical expertise offers a path to higher earning potential.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To determine which skills provide the greatest value for career growth, I analyzed both their demand in job postings and their median salaries. This made it easier to highlight the skills that offer the best balance of demand and compensation.

### Visualize Data

```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.scatterplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='median_salary', hue='technology')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US', fontsize=15)
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.legend(title='Technology')

ax=plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter())
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))

# Create a variable list for adjust_text()
texts = []

for i, txt in enumerate(df_plot.index):
    x = df_plot['skill_percent'].iloc[i]
    y = df_plot['median_salary'].iloc[i]
    texts.append(plt.text(x, y + 200, txt))

adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='grey', lw=1)) # lw= line width

# Manually adjusted the position of the SAS and Power BI labels to resolve overlap
for t in texts:
    if t.get_text() == "sas":
        t.set_position((t.get_position()[0]+1, t.get_position()[1]+500))
    if t.get_text() == "power bi":
        t.set_position((t.get_position()[0]-1, t.get_position()[1]-1500))

plt.show()
```

### Results
