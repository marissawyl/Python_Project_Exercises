# Introduction

This project is part of my learning journey to improve my Python skills for data analysis. It’s uses the Uber dataset from New York City covering the years 2014–2015, originally shared by Shan Singh on Udemy. Through this project, I aim to practice data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visualization to better understand real-world datasets.

# Background

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber generate a large amount of data every day. Analyzing such data can provide valuable information about passenger demand, peak hours, and how driver supply responds to that demand. In this project, I focused on understanding when and where demand is highest, identifying rush hour patterns across weekdays and months, and comparing the relationship between active vehicles and completed trips. Beyond being a technical practice, this project also demonstrates how Python can be applied to real-life scenarios.

# Tools Used

The analysis was carried out in Visual Studio Code using Jupyter Notebook. Python was the main language for the project, supported by several libraries for data analysis and visualization. Pandas was used for data cleaning and transformation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib together with Seaborn for creating visualizations.
