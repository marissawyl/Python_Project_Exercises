# Introduction

This project is part of my journey to deepen my Python and data analysis skills. I explored a dataset of job postings in 2024 provided by Luke Barousse to uncover trends and insights in the Indian job market. Through this project, I practiced cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data while learning how to translate findings into meaningful insights.

# Background

The goal of this analysis is to explore the demand for Data Analyst roles in India in 2024. While data engineering positions show the highest demand, I chose to focus on Data Analyst roles for several reasons:  
1. **Learning focus**: This project is primarily about honing data analysis skills, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.  
2. **Actionable insights**: Understanding trends in data analyst positions can help beginners or career switchers navigate the job market.  
3. **Manageable scope**: Analyzing Data Engineer roles could require deeper technical context and a broader skill set, which is beyond the scope of this learning project.  

By focusing on Data Analyst roles, I could concentrate on developing strong analytical and Python skills while still providing meaningful insights about the job market.

# Tools Used

I used Python along with essential libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. The project was developed in Visual Studio Code, which provided a robust environment for coding, testing, and visualizing results efficiently. This combination of tools allowed me to explore the dataset and generate professional, clear visualizations.
