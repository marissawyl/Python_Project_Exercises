# Python Data Analysis Learning Series

This repository is part of my personal learning journey to strengthen my skills in Python and data analysis. It includes four end-to-end mini projects, each focusing on a different dataset and analytical objective.  
Every exercise marks a step in my learning path, showing how I moved from simple data cleaning to working with real datasets, visualizing patterns, and sharing insights in a meaningful way.

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 1: Exploring the 2023 U.S. Data Job Market

Analyzed job postings from the United States to uncover demand, salary, and skill trends across data roles.  
Focus: Skill demand, salary comparison, and role-specific insights.  
Key tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 2: Deep Dive into Indiaâ€™s 2024 Job Market

Expanded the previous analysis using a 2024 dataset from Luke Barousse to explore how demand and pay vary across roles and skills in India.  
Focus: Skill importance, salary vs. demand analysis, and identifying optimal skill combinations.  
Key tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 3: Understanding Uber Trip Patterns in NYC (2014â€“2015)

Shifted focus from job data to transportation analytics using Uber trip data from New York City. Explored temporal and spatial trends to understand travel behavior.  
Focus: Time-based trends, trip density, and data wrangling.  
Key tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 4: Bitcoin Price Trends (2013â€“2017)

Analyzed Bitcoinâ€™s price history to visualize its growth, volatility, and market behavior during its early years.  
Focus: Time series analysis and interactive visualizations.  
Key tools: Python (Plotly, Pandas), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ§© Tools and Environment

- Language: Python
- Core Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Development: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook
- Visualization: Static (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Interactive (Plotly)
