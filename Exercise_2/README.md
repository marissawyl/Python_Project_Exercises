### Construct the Co-occurrence Matrix

```python
# Select the top n skills and convert to a set for .intersection()
top_skills1 = set([s1 for s1, _ in skills_count.most_common(top_n)])

coocurrence1 = Counter()

for skills_2 in df_2024_IN['job_skills']:
    filtered1 = top_skills1.intersection(skills_2)
    paired1 = combinations(sorted(filtered1), 2)
    coocurrence1.update(paired1)

pairs1, cnt = zip(*coocurrence1.items())
df_pairs1 = pd.DataFrame(pairs1, columns=['Skill_1', 'Skill_2'])
df_pairs1['cnt'] = cnt

df_matrix = df_pairs1.pivot_table(
    index='Skill_1',
    columns='Skill_2',
    values='cnt',
    fill_value=0
)

# Make sure skill names align in both rows and columns before transposing
skill_names = sorted(top_skills1)
df_matrix = df_matrix.reindex(index=skill_names, columns=skill_names, fill_value=0)

# Transpose the matrix to convert it into a full matrix
df_matrix = df_matrix + df_matrix.T
```
